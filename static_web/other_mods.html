        <h2>Sound Mods</h2>
        <p>
            Enhancing the sound profile of a custom keyboard has become one of the most enjoyable parts of the hobby, allowing builders to shape not only how their board feels but also how it sounds. Sound mods range from simple, inexpensive tweaks to more involved upgrades, each contributing to the signature acoustics enthusiasts seek—whether that’s a deep “thock,” a crisp “clack,” or something in between.
            One of the most common approaches is case and plate dampening. Adding materials like poron, neoprene, or foam inside the case reduces unwanted hollowness and gives the keyboard a more controlled tone. Many builders also use PE foam or switch films, which can brighten the sound or tighten switch housing for greater consistency. Tape mods, applied to the underside of the PCB, are another popular low-cost option that can make keystrokes sound fuller.

            Switch choice plays an equally important role. Lubing and spring-swapping can drastically change both pitch and smoothness, while different switch housings and stems produce distinct acoustic signatures. Finally, keycap material—ABS or PBT—further shapes the overall profile.
            By experimenting with these sound mods, keyboard enthusiasts can craft a typing experience that is uniquely personal and acoustically satisfying.

        <h2>Aesthetic Mods</h2>
        <p>
            Aesthetic mods are one of the most exciting parts of customizing a mechanical keyboard, allowing builders to transform a functional tool into a personal statement. While sound mods shape how a keyboard feels to type on, aesthetic mods define how it looks and how it reflects the user’s personality.

            The most noticeable change comes from keycaps. Whether it's classic doubleshot ABS, textured PBT, or specialty artisan caps, keycaps dramatically influence the visual identity of a board. Color-themed sets, retro-inspired designs, and novelty accent keys make it easy to match a keyboard to a desk setup or creative kind of vibe.

            Beyond keycaps, custom cases and plates add additional flair. Materials such as aluminum, polycarbonate, and wood offer different visual vibes, from premium and industrial to soft and translucent. Many enthusiasts also experiment with weight designs, engravings, and unique case shapes to make their boards stand out.

            Lighting mods, particularly RGB underglow and per-key LEDs, can create dynamic effects or subtle ambient glows. Paired with translucent switches or pudding-vibe keycaps, lighting becomes a central aesthetic feature.

            Finally, accessories like themed coiled cables, desk mats, and switch recoloring add finishing touches. Together, these aesthetic mods allow keyboard enthusiasts to build a board that feels just as expressive visually as it is satisfying to use.
