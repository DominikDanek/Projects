        <h2>Mechanical Switches</h2>
        <p>
          Mechanical keyboard switches are the components beneath each keycap that register key presses and give a keyboard its feel and sound.
          They consist of housing, stem, spring, and sometimes a slider or tactile bump. Switches vary by actuation force, travel distance, auditory
          profile, and feedback type (tactile, linear, or clicky). Enthusiasts choose switches to match typing vibe and preference: some prefer
          quiet, smooth linear travel for gaming, others prefer tactile bumps for typing accuracy. Switches are commonly sold in kits or in bulk
          and can be swapped on hot-swappable PCBs without soldering, making them a popular customization point.

        <h2>Tactile vs Linear whats the difference</h2>
        <p>
          Tactile and linear switches differ primarily in the feedback they provide during a keypress. Linear switches move straight up and down with a
          smooth, consistent resistance from top to bottom; there is no perceptible bump or physical feedback at the actuation point. This makes
          linears feel fluid and often quieter, which many gamers prefer because repeated rapid presses feel effortless. Tactile switches include a
          small bump partway down the travel that provides a noticeable physical cue when the key actuates. That bump helps typists know when a keypress
          registers without bottoming out, improving accuracy and reducing finger fatigue for some users. Tactile switches can be slightly louder or
          feel "heavier" because of the bump, while linears emphasize speed and smoothness. Choice between them comes down to whether you value clear
          feedback (tactile) or uninterrupted travel (linear).
